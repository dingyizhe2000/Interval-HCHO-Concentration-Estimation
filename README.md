# Interval-HCHO-Concentration-Estimation


This is the PyTorch implementation for our work--Mapping 2019 Global Surface HCHO Distribution and Confi-dential Interval by Satellite Observation of Sentinel-5P and Neural Network Model. With the usage of quality-driven interval estimation algorithm([High-Quality Prediction Intervals for Deep Learning](https://github.com/TeaPearce/Deep_Learning_Prediction_Intervals)), we manage to give the point and interval global surface HCHO concentration distribution map in 2019.
